                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>Ejenta was founded in 2012 by Dr. Maarten Sierhuis and is based in San Francisco, California. The company commercialized the Brahms agent-based modeling language, which Dr. Sierhuis created and developed during his tenure at NYNEX Science & Technology, and later as a senior research scientist at NASA Ames Research Center.</p>
                <p>Today, Ejenta continues to develop and apply Brahms to create intelligent agent-based solutions that connect people with data, devices, and services. Our mission is to model and analyze complex work systems to improve safety, efficiency, and collaboration in high-stakes environments, from space missions to healthcare.</p>

                <h2>History of Brahms</h2>
                <p>To explain why we became interested in creating an agent-based language to model and simulate human work practice, we need to go back in history. In an effort to design a new work system in one of the former Bell Telephone Operating Companies, the work system designers used an off-the-shelf workflow simulation tool to model the old and the new work process. The newly created design of this work process included a new designed coordination role. The work of a person playing this role did not include work activities that operated directly on the work product (i.e. the implementation of a high-speed data line).</p>
                <p>It turned out that it was very difficult to include this type of coordination work into a workflow model. The result was that the workflow model did not explain the need for this new coordination role. The frustration of the design team was that they could not explain the importance of this new role using the model, while the rationale of their design was solely based on the introduction of this new coordination role.</p>
                <p>Ironically, the company, because of the convincing power of the workflow simulation, adopted the design. However, in the implementation of the design the model gave little support and rationale for the design. In order to have a computer model that is convincing to the deciding powers, helpful for the understanding of the design, and helpful in the communication of that design, we started our effort in developing a modeling language and simulation environment that allows us to model the work activities and collaboration of people in a work process. Although useful, a workflow model typically omits collaboration, "off-task" behaviors, multi-tasking, interrupt and resume, informal interaction, and geography. In other words, workflow omits work practice.</p>
                <p>Therefore, we developed the Brahms multi-agent language. Brahms allows us to model the work activities of each type of role, and each individual (or artifact) playing that role in an organization. The focus of a Brahms model is on the context of work, meaning, how does the work really happen. One of the essential requirements for Brahms is that we can model collaboration and coordination between people working on one task, as well as that people can work on more than one task at a time, and are interrupted and able to resume their activities where they left off.</p>
