    </p>
    <p class="aisnormal">Brahms models may be thought of as statements in a new formal
    language developed for describing work practice. The <a href="http://agentisolutions.com/documentation/language/ls_title.htm">online language specifications</a> show the conventional
    notation and constructs used to express the syntax for the modeling language (BNF). The
    language is domain-general in the sense that it refers to no specific kind of social
    situation, workplace, or work practice; however, it does embody assumptions about how to
    describe social situations, workplaces and work practice. </p>
    <p class="aisnormal"><br>
    Brahms can model and simulate work practices. Brahms models are written in the
    agent-oriented language that will be described in this document. The run-time component -
    the simulation engine - can execute a Brahms model, also referred to as a simulation run.
    A Brahms model can be used to simulate human-machine systems for what-if experiments, for
    training, for 'user models', or for driving intelligent assistants and robots. A
    traditional task or functional analysis of work leaves out the logistics, especially how
    environmental conditions come to be detected and how problems are resolved. Without
    consideration of these factors, we cannot accurately model how work and information
    actually flows, nor can we properly design software agents that help automate human tasks
    or interact with people as their collaborators. What is wanted is a model that includes
    aspects of reasoning found in an information-processing model, plus aspects of geography,
    agent movement, and physical changes to the environment found in a multi-agent simulation.
    A model of work practice focuses on informal, circumstantial, and located behaviors by
    which synchronization occurs, such that the task contributions of humans and machines flow
    together to accomplish goals.</p>
    <p class="aisnormal"><br>
    Brahms makes this kind of models possible. Brahms relates knowledge-based models of
    cognition (e.g., task models) with discrete simulation and the behavior-based subsumption
    architecture. Brahms is centered on the concept of 'agents'. Agents' behaviors are
    organized into activities, inherited from groups to which agents belong. Most importantly,
    activities locate behaviors of people and their tools in time and space, such that
    resource availability and informal human participation can be taken into account. A model
    of activities doesn't necessarily describe the intricate details of reasoning or
    calculation, but instead captures aspects of the social-physical context in which
    reasoning occurs. Thus Brahms differs from other multi-agent systems by incorporating
    chronological activities of multiple agents, conversations, as well as descriptions of how
    information is represented, transformed, reinterpreted in various physical modalities.</p>
    <p class="aisnormal"><br>
    The Brahms language is structured around the following concepts:</p>
    <p class="aisnormal"><br>
     Agents and Groups<br>
     Objects and Classes<br>
     Beliefs and Facts<br>
     Workframes<br>
     Activities<br>
     Thoughtframes<br>
     Geography</p>
    <p class="aisnormal"><br>
    which can be related one to the other in the following way: </p>
    <p class="aisnormal"><br>
    <font face="Courier">Groups contain<br>
    agents who are located and have<br>
    beliefs that lead them to engage in<br>
    activities that are specified by<br>
    workframes that consist of<br>
    preconditions of beliefs that lead to<br>
    actions, consisting of<br>
    communication actions<br>
    movement actions<br>
    primitive actions<br>
    other composite activities<br>
    consequences of new beliefs and world facts<br>
    thoughtframes that consist of<br>
    preconditions and<br>
    consequences</font></p>
    <p class="aisnormal"><br>
    The Atm scenario will drive you through all of these concepts. It will first present them
    - step by step - and then it will ask you to use them in increasingly realistic Brahms
    representations of a scenario where students get cash from Atms and spend it at various
    restaurants. </p>
    <p class="aisheader2"><br>
    The Atm Scenario</p>
    <p class="aisnormal"><br>
    A Brahms file is a file written according to the rules of the Brahms language and
    identified with the .b extension. Most of your Brahms models (including the Atm case that
    you will build through this tutorial) will consist of more than one Brahms file. Unlike
    most other languages like C, Java or Pascal, Brahms does not have a main method that
    serves as the starting point for a Brahms simulation. While Brahms does not prevent you
    from placing more than one concept in one Brahms file, it is recommended that you create
    one .b file for each 'concept' that you specify for your model (note that a concept can be
    a group, agent, class, object, areadef, area, path, conceptual class or conceptual object;
    but we will go back to this in detail in the next sections). It is also recommended that
    you always create one Brahms file (.b) for your model that will import all the other .b
    files that are to be part of your model.</p>
    <p class="aisnormal"><br>
    <p class="aisnormal">The Atm scenario discussed in the following pages will teach you the
    various components of the language and the main differences between object-oriented and
    agent-oriented programming. The final challenge of the scenario is to model the following,
    complete case:<br>
    <p class="aisnormal"><br>
    <p class="aisnormal"><font face="Courier">Model a day in the life of a student. Students spend most of their time studying, but get
    hungrier as the time goes by. When they are particularly hungry, they
    decide to move to one of the restaurants in town. Students choose the restaurant according
    to how much money they are carrying. If a student does not have enough money even for the
    cheapest restaurant, she will decide to pass first by the Atm of the bank where she has
    her account. <br>
    When she arrives at the Atm, the student inserts her bankcard and tries to remember the
    PIN associated to her account. The Atm allows its users 3 attempts to digit the correct
    PIN, before refusing the card altogether. The Atm communicates with the central bank
    computer to verify the correctness of the information provided by the user. If the bank
    computer communicates to the Atm that the PIN is correct and that the user has enough
    balance in her account, the Atm will dispense the cash and will print an invoice with the
    account number and the remaining balance.<br>
    Students need to have enough balance in their accounts to take out cash: if they attempt
    to take out more money than they have, the bank computer will notify the students (through
    the Atm) of the remaining amount of dollars in the account. The student will modify her
    approach accordingly, and take out just exactly the remaining dollars. </font></p>
    <p class="aisnormal"><br>
    Don't worry - you will not have to model all of this right now! Chapter 4 will drive you
    through this scenario step by step, progressively adding components and activities and
    increasing realism and complexity. Still, to get you started and give you a sense for the
    language that you will be discovering, you will be now given an example of code coming
    from the Atm case itself. Clearly, you will not yet be able to 'read' this code. Still, it
    will be a good exercise to browse through it, trying to recognize the keywords that we
    described above, in order to get familiarized with the concept of a Brahms file. This file
    describes (some of) the activities of the student:</p>

    <p class="aisheader2"><br>
    Interpretation of the Scenario in an Agent-Based language</p>
    <p class="aisnormal"><br>
    At the core of Brahms there is the concept of agent. An agent represents an interactive
    system, a subject with behavior interacting with the world. An agent can for example
    represent a person in an organization, but could also represent an animal in a forest. A
    Brahms model is always about the activities of agents in a work process, and agents engage
    in activities depending on facts as well as the beliefs they have about facts in the
    world. Mapping the Atm scenario from objected oriented programming into Brahms, therefore,
    means that the modeler must adopt an holistic approach to modeling, trying to explain and
    simulate individual behavior through actions and decisions, and selecting what to keep
    inside the picture and what to take out. An exemplar Brahms embodiment of the Atm scenario
    discussed above could be the following (related Brahms concepts and keywords are indicated
    within parentheses):</p>
    <p class="aisnormal"><br>
    <font face="Courier">Alex (agent), a student (group) at Berkeley (location), has cash
    (object) and an account (object) at the Bank of America (instance of the class Bank) that
    he can access by using his cashcard (object) at an Atm machine (object with location).
    Alex studies most of the time, but as the time goes by he also feels the urge to eat.
    There are some restaurants in Berkeley, with different menus and prices. When he is
    hungry, Alex checks (thoughtframe) how much money he has, and whenever he needs more money
    to go to the restaurant and eat. Depending on his financial situation, therefore, he can
    then decide to (workframe) move (primitive activity) to the restaurant and eat, or instead
    go first to the Atm to get some cash (workframe, composite activity). At the Atm, Alex
    will insert his cashcard into the Atm machine, which will read the card and ask for its
    pin. The Atm then will communicate with the Bank, verify the card and the provided
    information, and complete or abort the transaction. To make things more interesting, there
    is another student, Kim, who does the same things Alex does but likes different
    restaurants, has a different time schedule, and has opened her account at a different Bank
    from the one Alex is using&#133;</font></p>
    <p class="aisnormal"><br>
    As it might be already clear from this short example (and it will get clearer the more you
    will progress into your tutorial), there is a deep conceptual difference between the way
    the Atm scenario can be dealt with in Brahms and the object-oriented approach. To write a
    proper Brahms model, you will have to think about the why of the various things agents and
    objects do. This is a more complete and more holistic approach. It is a human centered
    computing (HCC) view as opposed to the software engineering view. The latter might be
    satisfied with focusing on use cases; the HCC view instead studies why and how the human
    is using the machine, before designing the Atm machine itself. This also translates in
    language differences between Brahms and other object-oriented languages: Brahms is an
    agent-oriented language with elements of rule-based languages, where activities are not
    the same things as methods, and rules are not the same as if..then constructs of
    imperative languages. It is important to keep this in mind while modeling in Brahms in
    order to avoid errors and misunderstandings.<br>
