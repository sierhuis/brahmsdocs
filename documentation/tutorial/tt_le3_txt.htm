    <p class="aisheader2">Introduction</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">This chapter will teach you how to define and create groups (e.g.
    Students) and agents that are members of groups. It will also teach you about attributes
    and relations of Brahms groups and agents.
    </p>
    <p class="aisheader2">Task
    </p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">Create the group Student and agent Alex from the model schemas you
    have previously drafted. Alex is a student and will have attributes and relations that are
    relevant to the Atm scenario, such as; where agents study, feel hungry, and thereafter go
    and eat with money they obtain from Atms. In this section we will start with a small
    subset of attributes (for example, the gender, the hunger, and so on) and relations (like
    hasCard, and hasAccount), which will be expanded on as the Tutorial progresses.
    </p>
    <p class="aisheader2">Description
    </p>
    <p class="aisparagraph"><i>Agents and Groups</i></p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">The concept of a &quot;group&quot; in Brahms is similar to the
    concept of a template or class in object-oriented programming. A group represents a
    collection of 'agents' that can perform similar work and have similar beliefs. A group
    defines the work activities (activity frames and thought frames), the initial-beliefs of
    members in the group and the initial-facts about the agent in the world. The difference
    with classes in object-oriented programming is that the relationship between a group and
    its members is not an IS-A relationship, but a MEMBER-OF relationship. This is why we
    speak of &quot;a member of a group&quot; instead of &quot;an instance of a group.&quot;</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    In Brahms we use the notion of strong agency: Brahms agents model human behavior, and the
    Brahms modeling language implements in some way all of the attributes discussed in context
    of weak and strong agency, i.e. autonomy, social ability, reactivity, pro-activeness,
    mobility, and bounded rationality.</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    People and artifacts (both physical and conceptual) are represented as
    &quot;objects&quot;, generally having properties, such as geographical location, which may
    change over time depending on their interactions. The term &quot;agent&quot; is generally
    used to refer specifically to an object that represents a person or, more inclusively,
    that represents an interactive system that has behavior interacting with the world that we
    want to represent as having the capabilities of awareness, reasoning and a mental state -
    intentionality.</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    An agent is a construct that generally represents a person within a workplace or other
    setting being modeled. Agents have a name and a location. To specify what an agent does,
    the modeler defines activities and workframes for the agent. The key properties of agents
    are group membership, beliefs, workframes, thoughtframes, and location.</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph"><i>
    Groups and members of groups</i></p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    In Brahms, Agents are members of groups. It is possible to model actual individual's
    behavior-for example, the activity of an agent 'Alex' in the Atm model: the activities
    will then be defined local to agent 'Alex', and will be agent-specific (i.e. not inherited
    by other agents). However, most Brahms models will not go into as much detail as to define
    the activities of individual agents, but rather describe the behavior of abstracted groups
    of agents in entities called groups. In describing the activities of groups of agents, a
    specific agent will inherit the activities of the group. In this way we can describe the
    daily activities of the group in a more abstracted way (i.e. non-individual specific), but
    we can make it specific through the parameters and the attributes of each specific agent.</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    A group can represent one or more agents, either as direct members or as members of
    subgroups. Typically, a modeler would associate descriptions of activities with groups, so
    that a group represents a collection of agents that perform similar work. A group may have
    only one member and roles may be highly differentiated. Depending on the purpose of the
    model, agents in a model may represent particular people, types of people, or pastiches.
    The modeler may define groups to represent anything, such as &quot;service
    technicians&quot;, &quot;people who like sushi&quot;, or &quot;people who wear
    spacesuits&quot;. Each agent and group can be a member of any number of groups, providing
    that no cyclic membership results.</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    Groups and agents are the most central elements in a Brahms model. An agent represents an
    individual, whereas a group represents a group of individuals playing a particular role in
    an organization. The simulation engine schedules the constrained activities of agents, not
    for groups. However, being a member of a group, the group's constrained activities are
    also scheduled as they pertain to the individual agent. A Brahms model is always about the
    activities of individual agents in a work process. Agents in Brahms are socially situated
    in the context of work, the organization, and its culture. However, the Brahms language is
    a multi-purpose AOL, which means that there is nothing inherently in the Brahms language
    that constraints the programmer to use agents for other purposes.</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    In a model a hierarchy of groups can be built by defining the group-membership. A group
    can be a member of more than one group. An agent can be a member of one or more groups.
    When an agent is a member of a group the agent will 'inherit' (or 'instantiate')
    attributes, relations, initial-beliefs, initial-facts, activities, workframes and
    thoughtframes from the group(s) it is a member of.all attributes and relations are
    inherited by agents, including private ones (an agent can be seen as an instance of a
    group in terms of object oriented practices). In case the same constructs are encountered
    in the inheritance path always the most specific construct will be used, meaning that an
    attribute defined for the agent has precedence over an attribute with the same name
    defined in one of the groups of which the agent is a member.</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph"><i>
    Elements of agents and groups</i></p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    Brahms agents and groups may have the following elements.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="aisparagraph"><i>Name</i>: The name of an agent is its unique identifier. This element is not optional.
    Normally we give agents fictitious names to identify specific individuals in an
    organization without identifying them.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="aisparagraph"><i>Display</i>: The display name of an agent is an optional textual description of the agent's
    name. The display name can have spaces. It is not used as the unique identifier for the
    agent.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="aisparagraph"><i>Group-membership</i>: An agent can be a member of one or more groups. This element is
    optional. When an agent is a member of a group the agent will inherit all elements from
    the group(s) it is a member of. An agent can be seen as a member of a group. In case the
    same constructs are encountered in the inheritance path always the most specific construct
    will be used. For example, a workframe defined for the agent has precedence over a
    workframe with the same name defined in one of the groups of which the agent is a member.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="aisparagraph"><i>
    Cost and time</i>: The cost per unit (&quot;Cost/unit&quot;), and the unit time for which the
    cost is entered (&quot;Unit (seconds)&quot;). This element is optional. For example, if
    the cost attribute is 10.0 and the time attribute equals 3600 seconds it means that the
    cost of an agent is 10 BB's (Brahms Bucks) per hour. Using these attributes the simulation
    engine can calculate cost statistics of a work process, based on a calculation of the
    summation of an agent's activity time.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="aisparagraph"><i>Location</i>: An agent can have an initial location within the geography (see the previous
    section, 4.4). This element is optional.<br>
    Attributes: Represent a property of an agent or object in the world. Attributes can have
    values. Currently only single-valued attributes are allowed. The value of an attribute is
    specified through facts and/or beliefs (we will describe attributes in more detail later
    in this section). This element is optional.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="aisparagraph"><i>Attributes</i>: Represent a property of a
          group, agent, object class or object. Attributes are described in
          detail below.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="aisparagraph"><i>Relations</i>: Represent a relation between two concepts. A concept can be either an agent or
    and object. The first (left hand side) concept is always the concept for which the
    relation is defined; the second concept (right hand side) can be any concept. Relations
    are specified through facts and/or beliefs (we will describe relations in more detail in
    section 4.8). This element is optional.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="aisparagraph"><i>Initial-beliefs</i>: A belief is a first-order predicate statement about the world. This
    element is optional. Beliefs are always local to an agent, i.e. only the agent can access
    its beliefs, and no other agent can. This allows us to represent how a specific agent
    'views' the state of the world. Agents act based on their beliefs. Beliefs are the
    'triggers' of agent's actions. We will discuss beliefs in section 4.6. Initial beliefs
    define the initial state for an agent. Initial beliefs are turned into actual beliefs for
    the agent when the model is initialized at simulation start time.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="aisparagraph"><i>Initial-facts</i>: Facts represent the state of the world. A fact is a first-order predicate
    statement about the world. This element is optional. Facts are, in contrast to beliefs,
    global. Any agent can detect a fact in the world and turn it into a belief and act on it.
    Initial facts define the initial state of the world. Initial facts are turned into facts
    in the world when the model is initialized for a simulation run. There is a fundamental
    difference between the &quot;ownership&quot; of a belief and a fact. A belief is
    &quot;owned&quot; by a specific agent during the execution of the model. No other entity
    in the model can access that belief without some interaction with the agent (direct or
    indirect). However, although initial-facts are defined with an agent or object, at
    execution time a fact is not &quot;owned&quot; by that agent or object. A fact is global,
    and can be acted on (in the case of objects) or detected (in the case of agents). We will
    discuss facts in later lessons.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="aisparagraph"><i>Activities</i>: In this element the activities an agent can be engaged in are defined. This
    element is optional. Activities in Brahms take a certain amount of time, either derived or
    defined. There are a number of types of activities that are defined for the Brahms
    language. Activities defined are executed by workframes.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="aisparagraph"><i>Workframes</i>: In this element the activity rules, called &quot;workframes&quot;, are
    defined. This element is optional. Workframes describe the constraints of executing
    activities. Workframes are situation-action rules.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="aisparagraph"><i>Thoughtframes</i>: In this element the agent's inference rules, called
    &quot;thoughtframes&quot;, are defined. This element is optional. Thoughtframes are
    inherently different from workframes, as they do not execute any activities.</li>
      </ul>
    <p class="aisparagraph"><i>
    Attributes</i></p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    Attributes represent a property of a group, agent, object class or object. Attributes have
    values. In Brahms we currently only allow single-valued attributes. The value of an
    attribute is defined through facts and/or beliefs.</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph"><i>
    Attribute scope</i></p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">Attributes are always defined within a group, agent, conceptual-class, conceptual-object,
    class, object definition, area or area definition and cannot be defined outside any of
    these concepts or inside of any other concepts. Attributes can have different scopes
    within the specified concepts defined by one of the keywords private, protected or public.</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    Private attributes:</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    Private attributes are scoped down to only the concept for which it is defined. A private
    attribute is not inherited by sub-groups or sub-classes (agents/objects that are
    members/instances of the group/class will inherit the attribute) and the private attribute
    can only be referenced by initial beliefs, initial facts, workframes and thoughtframes for
    that specific concept. </p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    Protected attributes:</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    Protected attributes are inherited by sub-groups and sub-classes. Protected attributes can
    only be referenced by initial beliefs, initial facts, workframes and thoughtframes of the
    concept for which the attribute is specified or any of the sub-groups/sub-classes and of
    agents/objects that are members/instances of the sub-group(s)/class(es). </p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    Public attributes:</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    Public attributes are similar to protected attributes. The only difference is that they
    can be referenced by initial beliefs, initial facts, workframes and thoughtframes in any
    group, agent, class or object.</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    Value assignment:</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    Value assignment of attributes is done through the creation of individual beliefs and
    facts for agents and objects, rather than simply assignment operators like '=' or ':='. We
    will discuss this issue in much more detail in the next sections.</p>
    <p class="aisheader2">
    Tutorial</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    With this section, you will start populating your virtual world with some actors. Start
    creating a file Student.b, and write (do not forget the package declaration):
    </p>
      <blockquote>
    <p class="aisparagraph"><font face="Courier">package projects.Atm;<br>
    group Student {<br>
    &nbsp; attributes:
    </font></p>
    <p class="aisparagraph"><font face="Courier">&nbsp; relations:
    </font></p>
    <p class="aisparagraph"><font face="Courier">&nbsp; initial_beliefs: </font></p>
    <p class="aisparagraph"><font face="Courier">&nbsp; initial_facts:
    </font></p>
    <p class="aisparagraph"><font face="Courier">&nbsp; activities: </font></p>
    <p class="aisparagraph"><font face="Courier">&nbsp; workframes: </font></p>
    <p class="aisparagraph"><font face="Courier">&nbsp; thoughtframes:<br>
    }</font></p>
      </blockquote>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    It's ok that for the moment we have left most items blank. You have to start with
    something, right? 'Group Student' is the declaration that you are going to use to describe
    a new group with that name. You are not declaring such group as memberof any other group,
    which means that the Group Student will not inherit any previous attribute, or beliefs,
    etc, from other groups (apart from the default BaseGroup every Brahms group is based
    upon). On the other side, you could create more complex group hierarchies and memberships
    than the one we use in this tutorial, where students are simply members of the Student
    group. For example, you might model the group 'BankAccountHolder' and then make agents
    belong to both the Student and the BankAccountHolder group. Or you might have groups of
    groups - for example, a group EconomicStudent part of the group Student. These are
    modeling issues that you will have to face after you have mastered the basics of the
    Brahms language. For the moment, however, be careful about simpler issues such as the
    ordering of the components inside the Group Student definition: even if currently you do
    not know much about things like workframes or initial-beliefs, you must pay attention to
    write the declarations in the correct order (which is the order presented above) to avoid
    errors during compilation.</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    The group 'Student' is representative of all students in Berkeley, but in particular it
    must be suited to perform the tasks we want to model in the Atm scenario. A good way to
    achieve this goal is to start giving it proper attributes and relations. Let's start
    adding these lines to the Student group file:</p>
      <blockquote>
    <p class="aisparagraph"><font face="Courier">attributes:<br>
    &nbsp; public boolean male;<br>
    &nbsp; public double howHungry;<br>
    &nbsp; public double preferredCashOut;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    In Brahms, attributes can be of type boolean, double, int, symbol and string, but also
    other user-defined type (groups, classes, areas) and Brahms built-in meta-type definitions
    (such as Agent, Group, Class, etc.). 'Symbol' is just any value you want to give to an
    attribute without referring to it as a string. This has some advantages: it is easier to
    write down values for attributes that way (for example, rather than having a boolean type
    attribute 'male', we could have a symbol type attribute 'gender', which can have the
    values 'female' or 'male'). A symbol type can be seen as an enumerated type in languages
    such as Pascal, and C, except that we do not have to declare the possible values. Any
    value is possible.</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    In this tutorial, we start giving students some simple distinguishing characteristics:
    whether their gender is female or male, how hungry they are, and how much money they
    normally take out from their accounts when they go to an Atm. As you can see, for the
    moment we are not specifying any of these values: the student can be either female or
    male, can be very hungry or not hungry at all (let's assume that the higher the howHungry
    attribute is, the hungrier we consider the student), and can decide to take whatever cash
    he or she wants out of the bank. So, where do we specify these values?</p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    The answer can be given on two levels. First, attributes (as well as relations we will
    study in section 4.8) values are specified through facts and beliefs that we will model in
    the next section. We can specify such facts and beliefs right inside the Group Student
    body (did you notice there were already the labels for the initial-facts and
    initial-beliefs sections in the source code for the group Student?). Defining initial
    beliefs and/or facts in the group is appropriate only when they are common to the entire
    group. When this is not the case, we better specify these values inside the body of the
    Agent that is member of that group. </p>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    Now, create a new file and call it: Alex_Agent.b. Make sure that the name of the file is
    the same as the name of the concept that is being defined in the file; in this case
    Alex_Agent. Then add the following in the newly created file:</p>
      <blockquote>
    <p class="aisparagraph"><font face="Courier">
    package projects.Atm;<br>
    agent Alex_Agent memberof Student {<br>
    &nbsp; location: SouthHall;<br>
    &nbsp; initial_beliefs:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (current.howHungry = 15.00);<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (current.male = true);<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (current.preferredCashOut = 8.0);<br>
    &nbsp; initial_facts:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (current.male = true);<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (current.preferredCashOut = 8.0);<br>
    }</font></p>
      </blockquote>
    <p class="aisparagraph">
    Alex_Agent is the first agent in the Atm model. It is a member of the group Student, which
    means that every activity that will be described for the Student group, Alex_Agent wil be
    able to perform. The structure of an 'Agent' file can be exactly the same as that of a
    Group: we could have, again, workframes, thoughtframes and so on. The reason we rarely do
    so is because we almost never model specific activities, workframes and thoughtframes at
    the agent level: we prefer to model activities as activities of a group, performed by
    particular agents. However, there is nothing wrong with defining these elements at the
    agent level. In this case, we are only giving a particular location to our Agent: this
    means that when the simulation starts, Alex_Agent will be in that initial location (e.g.
    South Hall), while other agents might start elsewhere. Note that in this scenario we will
    model all the activities that agents perform (studying, eating, getting money from the
    Atm) within the Student group. That is: agents, such as students, will study, eat, get
    money from the Atm, etc. Other strategies are of course available: you might create other
    groups-for example, Bank Account Owners-and model activities for that group-such as going
    to the Atm; then, you would make the agents of your model be also members of that group.
    What solution is best? That is a modeling decision. Just remember the inheritance rules:
    in case the same constructs are encountered in the inheritance path, always the most
    specific construct will be used. This means that an element defined for a group the agent
    is directly member of, has precedence over an element with the same name defined in one of
    the groups of which the former group is a sub-group. </p>

    Hold on! We will not yet run the simulation. A little more patience and you will arrive to
    that. As you have seen, even though this section was about agents, groups and attributes,
    we could not help making reference to other concepts such as beliefs and facts. All of
    these concepts are interrelated in Brahms, because agents are the most important concepts.
    Agents act on the basis of facts and beliefs in a world made of objects, areas, other
    agents, activities, workframes, and thoughtframes . Hence, facts and beliefs is what we
    are going to explore in the very next section, in order to understand what the statements
    like 'current.preferredCashOut = 8.0' in the initial-beliefs and initial-facts section
    actually mean.</td>
