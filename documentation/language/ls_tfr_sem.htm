                <h3>Repeat</h3>
                <p>A thoughtframe can be performed one or more times depending on the value of the 'repeat' attribute. A
                    thoughtframe can only be performed once if the repeat attribute is set to false. A thoughtframe can be
                    performed repeatedly if the repeat attribute is set to true. In case the repeat attribute is set to
                    false, the thoughtframe can only be performed once for the specific binding of the variables at
                    run-time. The scope of the repeat attribute of a thoughtframe defined as part of a composite activity
                    is limited to the time the activity is active, meaning that the thoughtframe with a specific binding
                    and a repeat set to false will not execute repeatedly while the composite activity is active. As soon
                    as the composite activity is ended the states are reset and in the next execution of the activity it
                    is possible for the thoughtframe with the same binding to be executed. So only for top-level
                    thoughtframes the state will be stored permanently during a simulation run.</p>

                <h3>Priority</h3>
                <p>Setting the thoughtframe priority allows the model builder to control the execution sequence of
                    thoughtframes if more than one thoughtframe is available at the same time. The priority can be set by
                    setting it to a value greater than 0. Note that it is not recommended to use priorities to control
                    the sequence of thoughtframe execution. A better modeling practice is to define better preconditions
                    for the thoughtframes.</p>

                <h3>Defaults</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>display = &lt;thoughtframe-name&gt;</li>
                    <li>repeat = false</li>
                    <li>priority = 0</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Constraints</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The thoughtframe name has to be unique within the definition of a group, agent, object-class or
                        object.</li>
                    <li>It is not possible to use unassigned variables in thoughtframes, therefore the definition of
                        these variables is not allowed.</li>
                    <li>The consequences in thoughtframes can only conclude beliefs.</li>
                </ol>
