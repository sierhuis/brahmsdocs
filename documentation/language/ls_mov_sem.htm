                <h3>Declaration and reference</h3>
                <p>All activities have to be declared in the activities section of either a group, agent, class, object, or composite-activity. The declared activities can then be referenced in the workframes defined for the group, agent, class or object.</p>

                <h3>Parameters</h3>
                <p>It is possible to define input parameters for move activities. These input parameters can be used to make activities more generic. In the reference the values for the input parameters have to be passed. It is recommended to make the first parameter the goal-location of the move activity.</p>

                <h3>Priority</h3>
                <p>Activities can be assigned a priority. The priorities of activities in a workframe are used to define the priority of a workframe. The workframe will get the priority of the activity with the highest priority defined in the workframe.</p>

                <h3>Duration</h3>
                <p>Activities in general have a duration. In case of the move activity it is not necessary to define a duration of the activity. The duration of the activity is calculated by the simulation engine using the path definitions defining the distance between two locations. The simulation will determine the shortest path of travel from the current location to the goal location and calculate the travel time based on the distance. The duration of the move activity will in that case be the same as the calculated travel time. It is possible however to still define the duration of the activity. If the simulation engine cannot find a travel path then the defined duration will be used. The duration of the activity can be defined to be a fixed amount of time. The random attribute has to be set to false and the max-duration attribute has to be set to the maximum duration in seconds. The duration of the activity can also be defined to be a random amount of time. To define a random amount of time the random attribute has to be set to true, the min-duration attribute has to be set to the minimum duration of the activity in seconds and the max-duration attribute has to be set to the maximum duration of the activity in seconds.</p>

                <h3>DetectDepartureIn</h3>
                <p>The detectDepartureIn-property of the move activity specifies the areas for which the agents located in those areas will detect the moving agent leaving its current location. Those agents will retract the belief about the location of the moving agent if they have a belief about the location of the moving agent.</p>
                
                <h3>DetectDepartureInSubAreas</h3>
                <p>The detectDepartureInSubAreas property has as a value either true or false and specifies whether the departure of the agent is noticed by only the agents in the areas specified by the detectDepartureIn property or also the sub areas of the specified areas. If the value is true then not only will the agents located in the specified areas detect the agent's departure, also the agents in the sub areas of the specified areas will detect the departure. If the value is false the agents in the sub areas of the specified areas will not detect the departure. The default is true.</p>
                
                <h3>DetectArrivalIn</h3>
                <p>The detectArrivalIn-property of the move activity specifies the areas for which the agents located in those areas will detect the moving agent arriving in its destination location. Those agents will assert the belief about the new location of the moving agent.</p>
                
                <h3>DetectArrivalInSubAreas</h3>
                <p>The detectArrivalInSubAreas property has as a value of either true or false and specifies whether the arrival of the agent is noticed by only the agents in the areas specified by the detectArrivalIn property or also the agents in the sub areas of the specified areas. If the value is true then not only will the agents located in the specified areas detect the agent's arrival, also the agents in the sub areas of the specified areas will detect the arrival. If the value is false the agents in the sub areas of the specified areas will not detect the arrival. The default is true.</p>

                <h3>Defaults</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>display = &lt;activity-name&gt;</li>
                    <li>priority = 0</li>
                    <li>random = false</li>
                    <li>min_duration = 0</li>
                    <li>max_duration = 0</li>
                    <li>resources = none</li>
                    <li>detectDepartureIn = &lt;the start location of the moving agent&gt;</li>
                    <li>detectDepartureInSubAreas = true</li>
                    <li>detectArrivalIn = &lt;the destination location of the moving agent&gt;</li>
                    <li>detectArrivalInSubAreas = true</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Constraints</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The signature of an activity must be unique within the definition of a group, agent, class, object, or composite-activity. The signature consists of the name of the activity and the types of the argument list in the order the arguments are listed.</li>
                    <li>The input parameter type of a parameter defined in the declaration of an activity must be the same as the input value type or variable type in the reference of the activity.</li>
                    <li>The parameters assigned to any of the attributes must be of the correct type.</li>
                    <li>The parameter types for resources must be of type &lt;class-name&gt; or list-of &lt;class-name&gt;, the parameters assigned to the resources must be either VAR.variable-name or OBJ.object-name or a list of any of these two.</li>
                    <li>The location parameter must be of type &lt;areadef-name&gt;.</li>
                    <li>The parameter types for the 'detectDepartureIn' and 'detectArrivalIn' areas must be of type &lt;area-def-name&gt;, the values for the parameters assigned to the 'detectDepartureIn' and 'detectArrivalIn' property must be VAR.variable-name, PAR.parameter-name or ARE.area-name.</li>
                    <li>The detectDepartureInSubAreas and detectArrivalInSubAreas parameters must be of type boolean and its input values must be one of true or false.</li>
                    <li>The minimum duration of the activity defines the minimum duration in seconds.</li>
                    <li>The maximum duration of the activity defines the maximum duration in seconds.</li>
                </ol>
