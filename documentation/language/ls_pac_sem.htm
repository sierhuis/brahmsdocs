                <h3>Declaration and reference</h3>
                <p>All activities have to be declared in the activities section of either a group, agent, class, object, or
                    composite-activity. The declared activities can then be referenced in the workframes defined for the
                    group, agent, class or object.</p>

                <h3>Parameters</h3>
                <p>It is possible to define input parameters for primitive activities. These input parameters can be used
                    to make activities more generic. In the reference the values for the input parameters have to be
                    passed.</p>

                <h3>Priority</h3>
                <p>Activities can be assigned a priority. The priorities of activities in a workframe are used to define
                    the priority of a workframe. The workframe will get the priority of the activity with the highest
                    priority defined in the workframe.</p>

                <h3>Duration</h3>
                <p>Activities in general have a duration. The duration of the activity can be defined to be a fixed
                    amount of time. The random attribute has to be set to false and the max-duration attribute has to be
                    set to the maximum duration in seconds. The duration of the activity can also be defined to be a
                    random amount of time. To define a random amount of time the random attribute has to be set to
                    true, the min-duration attribute has to be set to the minimum duration of the activity in seconds
                    and the max-duration attribute has to be set to the maximum duration of the activity in seconds.
                </p>

                <h3>Resources</h3>
                <p>Artifacts (objects) can be defined as being a resource or not by setting the resource attribute to
                    either true or false. In general artifacts that are worked on by agents are not considered to be a
                    resource in an activity (a form, a fax). Artifacts that are used by an agent in an activity are
                    considered to be resources ( a fax machine, a telephone).</p>
                <p>It is possible to associate artifacts with activities for statistical purposes and for the purpose of
                    generating object flows by defining them in the list of resources for an activity. Artifacts which
                    are defined as resources are also called resource objects. Resource objects associated with
                    activities will only collect statistics and will not be used for the object flow generation.
                    Artifacts which are defined not to be a resource and which are associated with an activity are
                    also called touch objects. Touch objects should be associated with one or more conceptual
                    object(s) for object flow purposes and statistical purposes.</p>

                <h3>Defaults</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>display = &lt;activity-name&gt;</li>
                    <li>priority = 0</li>
                    <li>random = false</li>
                    <li>min_duration = 0</li>
                    <li>max_duration = 0</li>
                    <li>resources = none</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Constraints</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The signature of an activity must be unique within the definition of a group, agent, class,
                        object, or composite-activity. The signature consists of the name of the activity and the types
                        of the argument list in the order the arguments are listed.</li>
                    <li>The input parameter type of a parameter defined in the declaration of an activity must be the
                        same as the input value type or variable type in the reference of the activity.</li>
                    <li>The parameters assigned to any of the attributes must be of the correct type.</li>
                    <li>The parameter types for resources must be of type &lt;class-name&gt; or list-of &lt;class-name&gt;,
                        the parameters assigned to the resources must be either VAR.variable-name or OBJ.object-name
                        or a list of any of these two.</li>
                    <li>The minimum duration of the activity defines the minimum duration in seconds.</li>
                    <li>The maximum duration of the activity defines the maximum duration in seconds.</li>
                </ol>
