                <p>A put activity is a primitive activity that allows an agent or object to put down (drop) or transfer one or more objects and/or agents, referred to as items, carried by the agent or object performing the activity. The items are either dropped in the current or specified location or transferred to another agent or object. The carrying agent/object will no longer carry the item while performing future activities. An agent or object must have picked up, retrieved or received the items earlier by using the get activity (GET) or put activity (in case of transfer to the agent). If the agent or object is not carrying an item being put down by the carrying agent/object, then the put activity will do nothing except take time if a duration is specified.</p>
                <p>When the agents and/or objects are dropped or transferred, the put activity will generate the appropriate negation of the containment beliefs and facts. For each dropped agent/object the activity will generate a fact in the world and a belief for the agent/object performing the activity of the form:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>&lt;agent|object&gt; contains &lt;item&gt; is false</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>If the items are being transferred to another agent or object then for those items a new containment relation is generated both in the form of facts and beliefs:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>&lt;agent|object&gt; contains &lt;item&gt;</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Whenever the agent or object moves to another location it will no longer take the dropped items with it to that new location. For each item dropped in a location the activity will generate a location fact and a location belief for the dropped item for each agent that is located in the same location. The location of the dropped item will be the same location as the carrying agent or object if no destination is specified and the specified location if a destination location is specified. If the carrying agent or object does not have a location when the item(s) are dropped then the dropped items will not get a location either and no location facts and beliefs are generated for the dropped items.</p>
                <p>Note that the virtual machine will generate warnings if an agent tries to put an item down or transfer an item that is not contained by the agent/object performing the activity. The items for which a warning is generated are ignored.</p>
