                <p>A workframe is an action rule for an agent or object. It is a declarative description of under what condition (in case of an agent, beliefs that an agent has or in case of an object, the facts or beliefs in the world depending on the workframe type) the agent/object will perform the activities specified in the body of the rule. Workframes are treated like data-driven (forward chaining) production rules. However, workframes are different from production rules, in that they specify activities that agents and objects can perform (are engaged in) - production rules specify what conclusions can be drawn based on the conditions that are met.</p>
                <p>In Brahms we separate facts in the world from beliefs that agents have. For example, in Brahms we can have a fact <code>the color of John's Car is red</code>. Agent John might have the belief <code>the color of John's Car is red</code>, but agent Caroline might have the belief <code>the color of John's Car is green</code>. Agent workframes get "worked on" (in production rules systems we call this "get fired") based on the beliefs that agents have. This means that, in the example above, if John and Caroline have the same workframe using the belief of John's Car is red as a condition for the activation of the workframe; John will start working on the workframe, whereas Caroline will not start working on the workframe. Using this separation of beliefs and facts in the world allows Brahms to model agent's activities, based on changes in the world (facts) detected through detectables, and the agent-specific beliefs that are created. For objects beliefs are the information that an object carries. By default workframes for objects are only triggered by facts in the world, the type of the workframe is by default 'factframe'. If the type of the workframe is set to 'dataframe' then the workframe will be triggered by the beliefs of the object. The workframe is in that case an information processing frame. It is not possible to specify the type of the workframes for agents. Agent's workframes are only activated by beliefs matching the preconditions.</p>
