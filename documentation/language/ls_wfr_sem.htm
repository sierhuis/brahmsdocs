                <h3>Type</h3>
                <p>The type attribute can only be set for workframes defined for classes and objects. The value for the type attribute can be one of 'factframe' or 'dataframe'. The default value is 'factframe'. If the value is 'factframe' then the workframe's preconditions are matched against the facts in the world. If the value is 'dataframe' then the workframe's preconditions are matched against the beliefs of the object for which the workframe is specified. A dataframe is a workframe processing the data/information maintained by an object allowing the processed data/information to result in actions that change the state in the world.</p>

                <h3>Repeat</h3>
                <p>A workframe can be performed one or more times depending on the value of the 'repeat' attribute. A workframe can only be performed once if the repeat attribute is set to false. A workframe can be performed repeatedly if the repeat attribute is set to true. In case the repeat attribute is set to false, the workframe can only be performed once for the specific binding of the variables at run-time. The scope of the repeat attribute of a workframe defined as part of a composite activity is limited to the time the activity is active, meaning that the workframe with a specific binding and a repeat set to false will not execute repeatedly while the composite activity is active. As soon as the composite activity is ended the states are reset and in the next execution of the activity it is possible for the workframe with the same binding to be executed. So only for top-level workframes the state will be stored permanently during a simulation run.</p>

                <h3>Priority</h3>
                <p>The workframe priority can be set in one of two ways. The priority can be set by setting the value for the priority attribute or the priority can be deduced based on the priorities of the activities defined within the workframe, the workframe will get the priority of the activity with the highest priority. If no priority is specified the priority will be deduced from the activities, otherwise the specified priority is used.</p>

                <h3>Defaults</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>display = &lt;workframe-name&gt;</li>
                    <li>type = factframe</li>
                    <li>repeat = false</li>
                    <li>priority = 0</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Constraints</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The workframe name has to be unique within the definition of a group, agent, object-class or object.</li>
                </ol>
