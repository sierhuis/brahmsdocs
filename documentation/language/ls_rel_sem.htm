                <h3>Relation scope</h3>
                <p>Relations are always defined within a group, agent, conceptual-class, conceptual-object, class or object definition and cannot be defined outside any of these concepts or inside of any other concepts. Relations can have different scopes within the specified concepts defined by one of the keywords private, protected or public.</p>

                <h4><i>Private relations</i>:</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Private relations are scoped down to only the concept for which it is defined. The private relation is not inherited by sub groups or sub classes (agents /objects that are members/instances of the group/class will inherit the relation) and the private relation can only be referenced by initial beliefs, initial facts, workframes and thoughtframes for that specific concept.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4><i>Protected relations</i>:</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Protected relations are inherited by sub groups and sub classes. Protected relations can only be referenced by initial beliefs, initial facts, workframes and thoughtframes of the concept for which the relation is specified or any of the sub groups / sub classes and of agents/objects that are members/instances of the sub group(s)/class(es).</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4><i>Public relations</i>:</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Public relations are similar to protected relations, the only difference is that they can be referenced by initial beliefs, initial facts, workframes and thoughtframes in any group, agent, class or object.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Defaults</h3>
                <p>The default scope of a relation is 'public'.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>display = &lt;relation-name&gt;</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Constraints</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The name of a relation must be unique within the definition of a group, agent, class or object. In case of a name conflict in multiple inheritance (two different concepts from which is inherited define a relation with the same name) the following conflict resolution strategy is chosen. If both relations are of the same type just one definition will remain with the same name and same type. If the types of the relations differ an error will be generated.</li>
