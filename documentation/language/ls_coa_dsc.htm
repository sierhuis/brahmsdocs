                <p class="aisparagraph">A create object activity is a primitive activity allowing to dynamically create new (conceptual) objects or make copies of objects. The user can specify when the actual creation/copy has to take place by setting the 'when' value to either start or end. In either case, new or copy, a new (conceptual) instance is created and assigned to the unbound variable specified in the destination property of the activity.</p>
                <p class="aisparagraph">The (conceptual) class from which an instance is created is determined differently between the new and copy action. The behavior of the two will therefore be discussed separately.</p>
                <p class="aisparagraph">In case of a new action the activity will determine the class of the new instance from the source property. If the source specifies a class or conceptual class the activity will create an instance of that class. If the source specifies a (conceptual) object it will create an instance of the class of that (conceptual) object.</p>
                <p class="aisparagraph">In case if a copy action the activity will determine the class of the new instance from the destination property. The source will determine the (conceptual) class from the unbound variable. The activity then creates an instance of that class.</p>
                <p class="aisparagraph">After the instance is created and if the instance is an object and not a conceptual object the activity will determine whether it needs to place the object in a specific location. The activity first checks the location property. If a location is specified the instance will be placed in that location. If the location property does not specify a location the activity will check the source property. If the source property is an object it will check if that object has a location. If so the object will be placed in the same location as the source object. When the instance is placed in the location a fact will be created about the location of the new instance and all agents in that location will detect the new instance's location (they will get a belief about the location of the new instance).</p>
                <p class="aisparagraph">The newly created instance will be initialized, initial beliefs will be asserted to the belief set of the object and initial facts about the new instance will be asserted to the fact set of the world. If the instance is an object with behavior its work will be initialized.</p>
                <p class="aisparagraph">The activity will next determine whether the new (conceptual) instance needs to be made a part of conceptual objects. The activity first checks whether the conceptual-object property specifies any conceptual objects. If so it will make the new instance a part of those conceptual object(s). If no value is specified for the conceptual-object property the activity will check with the source. If the source property specifies an object or conceptual object, it will make the new instance a part of the same conceptual objects the source object is a part of. The appropriate aggregate relations will be generated as facts and beliefs.</p>
                <p class="aisparagraph">If the new instance is created as a copy the activity will copy all beliefs of the source object to the new instance. This is only performed if both the source and new instance are objects, not when they are conceptual instances.</p>
                <p class="aisparagraph">The last thing the activity does is bind the unbound variable specified in the destination property with the new instance.</p>
