                <p>The concept of a "group" in Brahms is similar to the concept of a template or class in object-oriented programming. A group represents a collection of 'agents' that can perform similar work and have similar beliefs. A group defines the work activities (activity frames and thought frames), the initial-beliefs of members in the group and the initial-facts in the world. The difference with classes in object-oriented programming is that the relationship between a group and its members is not an IS-A relationship, but a MEMBER-OF relationship. This is why we speak of "a member of a group" instead of "an instance of a group."</p>

                <h3>Functional Roles</h3>
                <p>In terms of organizations the concept is similar to that of functional roles in an organization. A group in Brahms could represent a typical role in an organization; The work activities that someone performs when he or she plays that role. For example, we could represent the role of Maintenance Technician or Central Office Engineer as a "group".</p>

                <h3>Structural Groupings</h3>
                <p>A group in Brahms can also depict an organizational group. For example, we can define a group as "Members of the Work System Design group at S&amp;T." We could now describe the work-activities, and initial-beliefs of members of the WSD group at S&amp;T.</p>

                <h3>Conceptual Groupings</h3>
                <p>We can also create informal groups related to conceptual definitions that make sense in the modeling activity. For instance, in modeling the people at S&amp;T we could create a group "People at 400 Westchester Avenue." We can now describe the activities and initial-beliefs that people at 400 Westchester Avenue have in common. This might not be that interesting, but in modeling people's interactions with legacy systems in NYNEX we could define a conceptual group of "LMOS users." In this group we could now describe how people interact with LMOS, and what initial-beliefs LMOS users have (for instance, the initial-belief that LMOS has data about today's trouble tickets).</p>
