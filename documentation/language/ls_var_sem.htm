                <h3>Quantification</h3>
                <p>Variables are of one of three quantification types: collect-all, for-each and for-one. The difference between the three quantification types is the way variables are bound to a specific context of a defined type (agent, object, or other value). The difference in binding is as follows:</p>

                <h4><i>for-each variable</i>:</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>A for-each variable is bound to only one context. For each context that can be bound to the variable a separate instance is created for the workframe in which the variable is bound.</p>
                    <p>For example in the following frame:</p>
                    <pre><code>workframe DoSomething {
  variables:
    foreach(Order) order;
  when (
    (order is-assigned-to current) )
  do {
    workOnOrder();
  }
}</code></pre>
                    <p>There are three Order instances in the model (order1, order2, and order3) satisfying the precondition. For this workframe three instances will be created in which the for-each variable is bound to one of the orders in each frame instantiation. This means that the agent for which the workframe is defined can only work on one order at a time and will work on them in consecutive order if no interruptions take place.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4><i>collect-all variable</i>:</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>A collect-all variable can be bound to more then one context. The variable will be bound to all contexts satisfying the condition in which it is defined. Only one frame instantiation will be created as a result of the binding with the collect-all variable. If we consider the same example as for for-each variables changing the quantification of the variable to collect-all.</p>
                    <pre><code>workframe DoSomething {
  variables:
    collectall(Order) order;
  when (
    (order is-assigned-to current) )
  do {
    workOnOrder();
  }
}</code></pre>
                    <p>Also assume that again three orders match with the precondition based on the beliefs of the agent, then all three orders are bound to the variable and one frame instantiation will be created for the agent to work on. This means that the agent for which this workframe is defined will work on all orders at the same time.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4><i>for-one variable</i>:</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>A for-one variable can be bound to only one context. Only one frame-instantiation will be created as a result of the binding with the for-one variable. A for-one variable binds to the first context satisfying the condition in which it is defined. If we consider the same example as for for-each variables changing the quantification of the variable to for-one.</p>
                    <pre><code>workframe DoSomething {
  variables:
    forone(Order) order;
  when (
    (order is-assigned-to current) )
  do {
    workOnOrder();
  }
}</code></pre>
                    <p>Also assume that again three orders match with the precondition based on the beliefs of the agent, then one of the orders will be bound to the variable and one frame instantiation will be created for the agent to work on. This means that the agent only works on one order and it doesn't matter on which order. The other two orders will not be worked on.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Defaults</h3>
                <p>A variable is by default an assigned variable unless otherwise specified.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>display = &lt;variable-name&gt;</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Constraints</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The name of the variable must be unique within the definition of a workframe or thoughtframe.</li>
                </ol>
