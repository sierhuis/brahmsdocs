                <p>A get activity is a primitive activity that allows an agent or object to pick up or transfer one or more objects and/or agents, referred to as items, from an area, agent or object, to carry it with it while performing activities. The picked up agents and/or objects are said to be contained by the agent or object that picked up the agents/objects. An agent or object can put the picked up agents/objects down or transfer them to another agent or object by using the put activity (PUT).</p>
                <p>When the agents and/or objects are picked up the get activity will generate the appropriate containment beliefs and facts. For each picked up agent/object the activity will generate a fact in the world and a belief for the agent/object performing the activity of the form:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>&lt;agent|object&gt; contains &lt;item&gt;</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>If the item(s) are being transferred from another agent or object then the containment relation for that item for the agent or object the item is transferred from will be negated.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>&lt;agent|object&gt; contains &lt;item&gt; is false</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Whenever the agent or object moves to another location it will take the contained items with it to that new location. The contained items will no longer have a location until they are put down in a location, i.e. no location facts will be generated for contained items. If the moving agent/object knows of the location of the contained item before the move it will also know of the location of the contained item after the move, i.e. a location belief will be generated for the carried agent/object for the carrying agent/object.</p>
                <p>Note that the virtual machine will generate warnings if an agent tries to get an item that is contained by another concept then the one specified as the source. The items for which a warning is generated are ignored.</p>
