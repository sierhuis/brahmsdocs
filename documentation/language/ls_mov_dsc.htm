                <p>A move activity is a primitive activity but is used to move an agent from its current location to the location as specified in the activity. The move activity first checks whether the duration is specified for the move activity. If the specified duration is larger than 0 it will use that duration for the move. If no duration is specified or the specified duration is 0 then the simulation engine tries to determine its duration by calculating the time it takes to move from the current location to the goal location using the shortest path specified between the two location. If no paths are specified between the locations then the duration of the move activity will be 0.</p>
                <p>When the move activity is started the agent or object being moved will be location-less. All of the facts and beliefs about the location of the agent will be retracted as well as the location facts and beliefs of the agents or objects contained by the agent or object. By default all agents in the same location as the start location of the move will detect that the agent/object is leaving and will retract the beliefs about the location of those agents and objects. It is possible to specify explicitly in which areas agents will detect the moving agent leaving the location by specifying a list of areas in the detectDepartureIn property for the move activity. By default all agents in the specified areas and their sub areas will detect the agent leaving and will therefore retract the location beliefs about that agent and the agents/objects being carried. If the detectDepartureInSubAreas is false then only agents in the specified areas will detect the departure, not the agents in the sub areas of the specified areas.</p>
                <p>When the activity is interrupted or impassed the agent or object will still remain location-less. It is possible that while the activity is interrupted the agent or object was moved to another location. If the agent or object moves while the activity was interrupted the duration of the interrupted activity will be recalculated as if the move starts all over again. If the agent or object did not move while interrupted then the activity will resume where it left of, the duration will not be recalculated, the activity will be active for the remaining duration.</p>
                <p>On arrival in the goal location a fact and belief will be asserted for the traveling agent or object about its new location. For all contained agents/objects a fact is asserted about their new location, the contained agents will also get a belief about their new location. By default the agents in the goal location will detect the traveling agent as well as any contained agents. The traveling agent and contained agent(s) will detect all the agents and objects in the goal location. For any of the contained objects the traveling agent will get a belief of the object if the agent already knew about the location of the contained object before it started the move. The model builder can control who detects the arrival by specifying a list of areas in the detectArrivalIn property for the activity. Only the agents located in the specified list of areas and their sub-areas will detect the arrival of the agent and its contained agents. If the detectArrivalInSubAreas property is set to false then the agents located in the sub areas of the specified areas will not detect the arrival of the agent and its contained agents.</p>
