                <h3>When</h3>
                <p>For each detectable, it needs to be specified when the agent or object can detect a certain fact. There are two options:</p>
                <p><i>whenever</i>:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>This means that the detectable is checked every time a new fact is asserted in the world and for an agent also every time a new belief is asserted.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p><i>at a specified time</i>:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>For the detectable, it needs to be specified exactly when the detectable needs to be checked by specifying a percentage varying from 0 to 100% specifying at what percentage of the workframe completion the detectable needs to check the fact set and belief set. These kinds of detectables are only checked once.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h3>&lt;Class Variable&gt;</h3>
                <p>Agents and objects do not always have the ability to know in advance about what concepts they can detect facts. To allow these agents and objects to detect facts about unknown concepts it is possible to define the class of concepts for which facts need to be detected. On the left hand side of the detectable condition instead of specifying the name of a variable, parameter or concept instance (agent, object, conceptual object, or area) the class of concept is specified in between the brackets &lt; and &gt; such as <code>&lt;BaseGroup&gt;</code>. This will have the agent or object detect all facts of which the left hand side concept instance is an instance of the specified class or an instance of any of its sub classes. The matches can be restricted by specifying a more specific class in the detectable condition. The agent or object will in that case only detect those instances that are instances of that class or any of its subclasses, but not any of its superclasses, even if the superclass defines that attribute and facts for concept instances of that super class exist.</p>

                <h3>Detect-certainty</h3>
                <p>The detect-certainty is a number ranging from 0 to 100 and represents the percentage of chance that a fact will be detected based on the detectable. A detect-certainty of 0% means that the fact will never be detected and basically means that the detectable is switched off. A detect-certainty of 100% means that a fact will always be detected based on the detectable.</p>

                <h3>Detectable action</h3>
                <p>There are 5 different detectable actions possible:</p>
                <p><i>continue</i>:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Has no effect, only used for having agents or object detect facts and turn them into beliefs.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p><i>impasse</i>:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Impasses the workframe on which the agent or object is working until the impasse is resolved.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p><i>abort</i>:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Terminates the workframe on which the agent or object is working immediately.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p><i>complete</i>:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Terminates the workframe on which the agent or object is working immediately, but still executes all remaining consequences defined in the workframe. All remaining activities are skipped.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p><i>end_activity</i>:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>This action type is only meaningful when used with composite activities. Causes the composite activity on which the agent or object is working to be ended.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Defaults</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>when = whenever</li>
                    <li>dc = 100</li>
                    <li>action = continue</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Constraints</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the comparison the left hand side attribute type and the right hand side value-type or right hand side attribute type of a value-expression must be the same. Object-attribute-index is considered type compatible with any type and is permitted on both the left and right hand side. For detectables the right hand side is ignored and therefore no errors or warnings will ever be generated even if the right hand side resolves to a value that is type incompatible with the left hand side. However for the trigger the right hand side is relevant and if the value resulting from evaluating the right hand side is type incompatible with the left hand side a warning is generated in the log and the detectable action is not executed.</li>
                    <li>In the comparison the left hand side and right hand side types in a relational expression must match the types as defined for the relation used in the relational expression. Only the right hand side permits an object-attribute-index expression and resolves to the unknown type which is type compatible with any type. The virtual machine will at run-time ensure that the resulting value is type compatible with the left hand side, if not it will generate a warning in the log and the detectable action is not executed.</li>
                    <li>ID.name when used as the left hand side concept must be the name of a concept class, i.e. a group, class, conceptual class or area definition.</li>
                    <li>The value of the detect-certainty ranges from 0 to 100 and represents a percentage.</li>
                    <li>The end-activity action type can only be used when a detectable is defined in a composite activity.</li>
                </ol>
