                <h3>Declaration and reference</h3>
                <p>All activities have to be declared in the activities section of either a group, agent, class, object, or composite-activity. The declared activities can then be referenced in the workframes defined for the group, agent, class or object.</p>

                <h3>Parameters</h3>
                <p>It is possible to define input parameters for composite activities. These input parameters are in the first place used to pass on variables defined in a workframe for use in the workframes defined for the composite activity and second they can be used to make activities more generic. In the reference the values for the input parameters have to be passed.</p>

                <h3>Priority</h3>
                <p>Activities can be assigned a priority. The priorities of activities in a workframe are used to define the priority of a workframe. The workframe will get the priority of the activity with the highest priority defined in the workframe.</p>

                <h3>Duration</h3>
                <p>Composite activities themselves do not have a duration. Composite activities are decomposed into other workframes that a concept can work on as part of the activity which eventually result in a primitive activity to be executed having a specific duration.</p>

                <h3>End-condition</h3>
                <p>The end-condition of a composite activity defines how a composite activity can be ended. There are three possibilities:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Only end it on the basis of an end-activity detectable. The end-condition has to be set to ‘detectable’. When a detectable having an action type of ‘end-activity’ is detected the composite activity will be ended.</li>
                    <li>End the activity when there’s no more work to work on. The end-condition has to be set to ‘no-work’. If none of the workframes as defined in the composite-activities can be worked on the activity will be ended.</li>
                    <li>End the activity when there’s o more work to work on, or when an end-activity detectable is detected. The end-condition has to be set to ‘no-work’ and an end-activity detectable needs to be defined for the composite activity. This case combines the first two cases.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Defaults</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>display = &lt;activity-name&gt;</li>
                    <li>priority = 0</li>
                    <li>end_condition = nowork</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Constraints</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The signature of an activity must be unique within the definition of a group, agent, class, object, or composite-activity. The signature consists of the name of the activity and the types of the argument list in the order the arguments are listed.</li>
                    <li>The input parameter type of a parameter defined in the declaration of an activity must be the same as the input value type or variable type in the reference of the activity.</li>
                    <li>The parameters assigned to any of the attributes must be of the correct type.</li>
                </ol>
