                <p>The Brahms language provides support for the <code>'unknown'</code> value and <code>'unknown'</code> truth-value in beliefs, facts, preconditions, consequences, detectables and transfer definitions.</p>
                <p>The <code>'unknown'</code> value is a type independent value and can be assigned to any variable, parameter, attribute or relation. The model builder must be aware that the value <code>'unknown'</code> can at runtime potentially be assigned to a property of an activity (such as <code>max_duration</code>). Properties such as <code>max_duration</code> do not allow the value <code>'unknown'</code>. If such a value is assigned anyway at runtime then the virtual machine will generate a warning in the virtual machine's log and use the default value for that property. If however no default value is available for the property an error will be generated and the agent/object in which the error occurred will be halted.</p>
                <p>The <code>'unknown'</code> value can be tested for in preconditions, can be communicated in communication and broadcast activities, can be detected using detectables and can be concluded using consequences. Note that when the value <code>'unknown'</code> is concluded for a relation that all the previously existing values for that relation are retracted. If an agent concludes that it doesn't know the value of the relation (unknown) it is necessary to remove all existing values for the relation. The reverse is valid as well. If an agent concludes a value for a relation other then <code>'unknown'</code> and the value <code>'unknown'</code> was already present for that relation, then the <code>'unknown'</code> value will be retracted and replaced by the new value.</p>
                <p>The value <code>'unknown'</code> for the truth-value can be used to specify that the truth-value for a relation is unknown or uncertain. The <code>'unknown'</code> truth-value can also be tested for in preconditions and can be used in consequences to conclude the truth-value.</p>
                <p>Before reporting any errors to the support team when a model doesn't behave as expected make sure to check the <code>vm.log</code> file first. This log file might list warnings or errors that relate to assigning the value <code>'unknown'</code> to a property of an activity that doesn't allow for the value unknown.</p>
