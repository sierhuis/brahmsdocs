                <h3>Declaration and reference</h3>
                <p>All activities have to be declared in the activities section of either a group, agent, class, object, or composite-activity. The declared activities can then be referenced in the workframes defined for the group, agent, class or object.</p>

                <h3>Parameters</h3>
                <p>It is possible to define input parameters for communicate activities. These input parameters can be used to make activities more generic. In the reference the values for the input parameters have to be passed. It is recommended to make the first parameter(s) in a communicate activity the concepts with which is communicated.</p>

                <h3>Priority</h3>
                <p>Activities can be assigned a priority. The priorities of activities in a workframe are used to define the priority of a workframe. The workframe will get the priority of the activity with the highest priority defined in the workframe.</p>

                <h3>Duration</h3>
                <p>Activities in general have a duration. The duration of the activity can be defined to be a fixed amount of time. The random attribute has to be set to false and the max-duration attribute has to be set to the maximum duration in seconds. The duration of the activity can also be defined to be a random amount of time. To define a random amount of time the random attribute has to be set to true, the min-duration attribute has to be set to the minimum duration of the activity in seconds and the max-duration attribute has to be set to the maximum duration of the activity in seconds.</p>

                <h3>Type</h3>
                <p>The type attribute defines what type of communication is used. The type can be one of phone, fax, email, face2face, pager, or none (meaning not specified).</p>

                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>The about attribute specifies what beliefs are to be communicated. The transfer definition specifies either the beliefs that are to be transferred or a CommunicativeAct defining the message to be transferred. If the transfer definition is a CommunicativeAct and the transfer action is 'send' then any destination agent or object can be specified. However if the transfer definition is a CommunicativeAct and the transfer action is 'receive' then the value of the 'with' attribute must be the CommunicativeAct declared in the transfer definition to indicate that the agent or object wishes to read the contents of the CommunicativeAct. An agent is not permitted to directly receive a CommunicativeAct from another agent. The agent in such a case is required to request the agent for the message and the receiving agent can then choose to send the requesting agent the desired CommunicativeAct.</p>

                <h3>When</h3>
                <p>The when attribute defines when the actual communication has to take place, at the 'start' of the activity or at the 'end' of the activity.</p>

                <h3>Defaults</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>display = &lt;activity-name&gt;</li>
                    <li>priority = 0</li>
                    <li>random = false</li>
                    <li>min_duration = 0</li>
                    <li>max_duration = 0</li>
                    <li>resources = none</li>
                    <li>type = none</li>
                    <li>when = end</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Constraints</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The signature of an activity must be unique within the definition of a group, agent, class, object, or composite-activity. The signature consists of the name of the activity and the types of the argument list in the order the arguments are listed.</li>
                    <li>The input parameter type of a parameter defined in the declaration of an activity must be the same as the input value type or variable type in the reference of the activity.</li>
                    <li>The parameters assigned to any of the attributes must be of the correct type.</li>
                    <li>The parameter types for resources must be of type &lt;class-name&gt; or list-of &lt;class-name&gt;, the parameters assigned to the resources must be either VAR.variable-name or OBJ.object-name or a list of any of these two.</li>
                    <li>The type-parameter type has to be a literal-symbol and its values must be one of phone, fax, e-mail, face2face, pager, or none.</li>
                    <li>The with-parameter type has to be one of 'Agent', CLS.object-class-name, list-of Agent or list-of CLS.object-class-name and its input value must be one of AGT.agent-name, OBJ.object-name, VAR.variable-name or a list of any of these elements. The with-parameter must be of type CommunicativeAct if the about-parameter specifies a transfer definition of type 'receive(&lt;CommunicativeAct&gt;)' and must be the exact same CommunicativeAct value as specified in the transfer definition.</li>
                    <li>The when parameter must be of type <i>symbol</i> and its input values must be one of <i>start</i> or <i>end</i>.</li>
                    <li>The minimum duration of the activity defines the minimum duration in seconds.</li>
                    <li>The maximum duration of the activity defines the maximum duration in seconds.</li>
                </ol>
